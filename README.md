# pystk-gym

A gym env for the game SuperTuxKart using pystk.

TODO:

- should i add enum type for all the infos?
- pystk init -> pygame init -> pygame cleanup -> pystk cleanup
- figure out why 2 gl context can't be in the same thread
- add another method just to visualize the agent playing
- write tests
- take a look at highway_env for reference
- don't calculate info (waste of computation)
